# Musk Ox Optimizer for Global Electricity Load Forecasting

This repository contains the implementation of a hyperparameter optimization framework using the Musk Ox Optimizer (MOO) for deep recurrent neural networks.

The framework evaluates LSTM and GRU models optimized with:
- Random Search
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Musk Ox Optimizer (MOO)

The models are validated on multiple electricity load forecasting datasets at hourly resolution.

## Features
- Global multi-series forecasting
- Fair optimizer comparison
- Statistical significance testing
- Reproducible experiments
